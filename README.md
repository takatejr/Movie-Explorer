# Movie Explorer

# Case:

    - Search feature
    
# Additional tech used:

    - styled-components,
    - pagination, for "all titles matching user input".

# Why not state management:

    It's enough simple app, if this case would be a part of something larger,
    then may be used React-Query for caching, Context API or Redux.

# Addition:

    - styles in components for now, depends on style coding,
    could be modules or styles as props.
